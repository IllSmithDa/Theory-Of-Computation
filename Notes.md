1. Lambda Calculus: formal mathmatical system for modeling computation. It is able to support the same computational ablities as a Turing machine. Calculus is how logic and formal analysis can describe behavior of things. 

2. Turing Machines: mathmatical method of computation that defines an abstract machine. Turing machines proce fundamental limitations of the power of mechanical computation in that their minimalistic design makes tham unsuitable for computation in practice. 

3. Finite state machine: The basis of which the rest of computation is built upon. State machine are just collection of states and transitions between the states. The transition are events which cause one state to become another state. e.g You were sad but got a raise so now you are happy. start state = sad, transition/event = raise, terminal state = happy;

4. Regular Expressions: A sequence of characters that define a search pattern. They can be directly converted into state machines and vice versa and is known as consuming a certain type of character. 

5. Backus Naur Form: Used to describe grammer and is a concise and compact way of describing a exact syntax of a language.
